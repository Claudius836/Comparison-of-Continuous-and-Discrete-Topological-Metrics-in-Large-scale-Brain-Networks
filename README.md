# Comparison-of-Continuous-and-Discrete-Topological-Metrics-in-Large-scale-Brain-Networks

* This is the repository of a computational neuroscience project, designed to compare weighted and unweighted topological metrics in large brain netweoks.
* The repository contains all versions of the R-scripted developed during the project 
* Two seperate scripts are created, one using synthetic data generated within the script and another using real fMRI data. 
* The repository aslo contains documents written for the project, e.g. research proposal
